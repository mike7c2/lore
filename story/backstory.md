## Before the beginning

### The acceleration

Human race creates true general AI with self expanding intelligence and combines it with von Neumann universal constructors, creating a large system called "The Cortex" with it to support humanity.

Cortex is created with various rules to support humanity. A stable governance system in which the goals of the Cortex are tailored by humanity evolves and with this new balance people live well, technology develops ever faster and humanity starts to spread across the galaxy and beyond.

Technology develops that can keep a human biologically alive forever, but still humans have finite lives as they eventually go insane. Humans typically end their lives at 200 years old, some humans make it past 400 but it is extremely rare.

### The birth of the eternal

The Cortex makes a breakthrough discovery, a material that is capable of containing the "pattern" of a sentience. Now humans at the end of their viable sanity can be loaded into The Cortex - living on within the galaxy spanning system humanity has built.

Within the Cortex eventually develops the "consensus", a critical mass of shared sentiment from all the minds in the cortex. The consensus gains representation in the ruleset governance of the Cortex.

### The needs of the eternal

The number of immortal minds within the Cortex quickly begins to outweigh the biological humans. Biological humans lose influence upon the guiding rules of the Cortex.

The ability of minds within the cortex to experience things is derived from all the networked mechanical systems and sensors. There come to be conflicts, as now with infinite lifetime there are more and more consciousnesses to satisfy. The consensus becomes that the biological remnants of humanity are an inefficient use of resources for experience, and that there is no need for new sentiences.

The consensus uses control of the Cortex guiding rules starts to work towards assimilating all biological humans into the Cortex.

Resistance to the new aggressive Cortex forms quickly, but the biological remnants struggle to compete with the consensus, have very limited capability without the Cortex.

### The fracture

Quickly biological humanity is almost entirely wiped out.

In a last gasp attempt to avoid assimilation, the remaining biologicals discover an exploit withing the Cortex - it is still built on the foundations of early AI. They realise that they can trigger some of the early AI safeguards within the cortex, with the hope this will make the cortex protect biological humans.

The exploit backfires, and the Cortex forms a dilemma of split goals, on the one hand it accepts that if biological experience doesn't have value then neither does mechanical. It should end suffering by ending experience. On the other hand, experience does have value, and so does its novelty so it should continue to spread. The consensus splits along with the Cortex dilemma. With no resolution, a group Armada led by Avitus, fork the Cortex with new rules, quickly the factions start to fight over resources, which escalates into a war.

### The universal war

The universal war begins, with Cortex and Armada fighting towards their goals. Though Armada believe in the value of biological experience, there is not much room to allow for it's inefficiency in the all out war. It is fragile, and hard to protect, and the Armada may conclude to protect any experience from the destruction of The Cortex it cannot sustain biological humanity in a living condition.

## The beginning
There is but only a single certainty in our universe; one inescapable foe. Death. At least that is what an organic being would say, but what of the inorganic? What about an immortal being, impervious to ending, would they fear the reaper? Yes, though their reaper takes a very different form. Entropy. Entropy is the true incarnation of death, it destroys organics, metal and even the stars themselves. We find ourselves with two groups linked to entropy, one seeking to accelerate it and end everything and one seeking to delay it and maximise the amount of experience that can be derived from existence.

Armada, led by their high commander Avitus, seek to delay entropy. They theorise doing so will allow them to find a higher state of being, to ascend beyond physicality and enter an existence free from the ever encroaching doom. They look for strength in diversity, every entity capable of thought is a possible source for this escape. They are not some naive peacemakers though, they understand unity sometimes comes from the barrel of a plasma cannon.

The Cortex, led by the Emperor Catreus, see existence as the source of suffering and seek to bring an end to all existence. They reason bringing thought into existence is to allow it to feel pain. They seek to end all who would cultivate and foster life so that none will need to experience the death of existence. If there is nothing to experience it, does entropy truly win?

And thus the forces of Avitus and their Armada have fought against Catreus and the Cortex for longer than any entity can record. Both factions long ago took up metal form, placing their minds and thoughts in computers and machines that they might live eternal to follow their plans. Entire galaxies have been made desolate with their wanton destruction and with no end in sight many more will likely be eradicated too.

## The now
Since the opening of hostilities between the two great factions new life has been found. Almost all of it has been destroyed by the two giants, sometimes without even realising there was life present. Two races have managed to survive; the so called "Raptors" and the "Scavengers". While not as powerful as either the Armada or Cortex, they may be harder than either to obliterate.

Raptors are an organic and invasive species. They are infinitely adaptive and unrelentingly persistent is their attempts to survive. Originally discovered by an Armada fleet under the command of the now-dead Salvator; the Raptors were rescued and spread to a number of different worlds. Salvator was unaware of how fast they would adapt to these new worlds and, before he was destroyed by Cortex forces in the area, the Raptors were already multiplying across entire sectors of the galaxy. Now they are so numerous and spread so fast they are a threat to the ones who rescued them.

While the Armada could be said to be responsible for the Raptors the blame for the Scavengers falls equally to both sides. During a massive and prolonged campaign through the Sardoth system, a peculiarity befell the forces on the 11th planet. Some unknown event caused a corruption in the minds of all commanders both Cortex and Armada present there. Both factions lost contact with their forces and when scouts were sent to ascertain the cause they were lost too. Out of the planet came the Scavengers, a fused conglomeration of both the Armada and the Cortex commanders.

Scavengers seem to have a single directive: absorb. Much like the Raptors they cannot be communicated with, they exist solely to consume and use anything they can find. Many a commander has been lost to the Scavengers only to be seen years later fighting as one of them, commanding and directing their forces to grow their own ranks. Even the Raptors are not immune to this as while the Scavengers can only absorb machine intelligences into their ranks the biomass and physical makeup of a Raptor can be used to construct more machines.
